<h1> ELIMINATION HEALTH </h1>

<h2> A food diary app for an elimination diet! </h2>

<p>
This full stack app was built using the following development technologies:
  <ol>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Handlebars</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>SCSS</li>
  </ol>

  <br>

  How I started:
    After building out the backend in Ruby and deploying it to heroku, I started by creating a bare bones html page with multiple input feilds and buttons. Fron there I started creating my RESTful routes for each field. I started with CREATE and once that worked went on to INDEX, PATCH, DELETE respectivly.

After all these request were working locally I deployed my app to github pages. From there I used bootstrap and sass to further design the user interface. Adding alerts, modals, tables, and forms I created the basic layout the user can see.

Here are my User Stories:
  <ol>
    <li>The User can create a new account</li>
    <li>The User can Sign in and change password if desired</li>
    <li>The User can see their meals if any exist</li>
    <li>The User can create new meals</li>
    <li>The User can Edit their meals and see the chnages on the screen</li>
    <li>The User can delete a meal if desired</li>
    <li>The User can sign out</li>
    <li>The User can't see any other users meals but their own</li>
  </ol>
